# Jane Street vs Sebi: comments 

On June 4th, SEBI had declared that it would seize 48.4 billion rupees or $570 million from the large trading firm — Jane Street Group — which it claims were unlawful profits made by the US firm. SEBI has momentarily placed Jane Street on a ban from trading in the country’s securities after a $4.3 billion trading gain. 


## What is option trading ?

Opposed to buying or selling a stock index at an unpredictable price, equity options allow investors to buy or sell stock indexes at a predetermined price, under a certain time frame. These options are particularly used to hedge against the volatility of elsewhere in their portfolios. Essentially these products are a way to place speculative bets on the moves in the market. For example instead of buying a stock index at $100 you would buy say a call option for $5 if you think the index is going to rise. A call option gives you the right to buy the index at a predetermined price, while a put option allows you the right to sell the index at a predetermined price. Now say the expiry of my call option is a month, and I have the right to buy the index at a price of $105, if the stock price goes above that value in the month, my option is “in the money,” and I profit. Call option prices have a direct relationship with the price of the stock index, and put options are inversely related with the price of stock indexes. 


## Jane Street's Strategy 

The US firm is being accused of exploiting the gap in liquidity between the option and cash market. Jane Street allegedly bought large quantities of call options when they were priced cheaply due to an event on the night of January 16th, according to Jane Street. This was the first step to initiating the strategy.

To increase the price of these call options, Jane Street is accused of purchasing large amounts of stocks within the Bank Nifty index. As the index value rose quickly due to the low liquidity in the cash market, the call options became more expensive. Jane Street claims they bought the Bank Nifty index as a hedge, they bought both simultaneously, however SEBI recently had reported they bought the stock index before the purchase of the calls — which would be market manipulation. Once the price of the call options had risen due to the increased index value, Jane Street allegedly sold these call options, locking in a profit from the price rise.

Jane Street is also accused of buying put options, which were cheaper at the time since the index was at a high point. These puts were expected to increase in value as the market corrected. In parallel, Jane Street allegedly sold the Bank Nifty index stocks, causing the index value to drop. As a result, the value of the puts increased. Selling the Puts: Jane Street then allegedly sold these put options at a higher price while buying back the call options at a lower price than they were initially sold for. This allowed Jane Street to profit from both the puts and calls, manipulating the market for their own benefit. 

SEBI reported that this strategy created a misleading appearance of market activity, causing retail investors to trade at what would be artificially inflated prices. Jane Street dissents these allegations, arguing that their trades were standard strategies, and that they had acted on the cash and option market simultaneously opposed to doing so at different times which SEBI reports. 

The incident has drawn significant attention due to the large scale of the trades involved and their impact on India’s markets, one of the largest globally. SEBI’s actions reflect growing concerns over market manipulation and the protection of retail investors in the rapidly expanding Indian financial markets.
