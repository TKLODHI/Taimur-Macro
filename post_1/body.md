# Oil Prices and Geopolitical shocks in retrospect

With the rising tension in the middle east this month, oil markets have turned a cold shoulder to the unfolding conflict. Oil prices over the last few weeks, despite the Iran and Israel friction have been subdued – an unusual phenomenon in relation to recent years. In 2008 after an Israeli military training exercise, crude oil prices surged from $90 to a record high of around $150 a barrel mid year. With the current conflict WTI has seen an increase from around $60 to a peak of $75 a barrel. The widely-held expectation was that, upon a crisis of this type, WTI would surpass $100 / barrel.

At least two narratives have been popularised as an explanation of oil’s anomalous behaviour:

Supply of oil has diversified globally in the past decade. Back in 2008, the U.S. ranked as the fourth largest oil producer globally, but today it is the world’s largest producer — a shift largely driven by the rise of US shale oil and advancements in drilling technology. Hence Washington can worry less about such constraints with the conflict in the middle east — elbowing out Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iran and every member of the OPEC+ cartel in oil production. 

Another rationale for this aberrant reaction is the fact that the demand for oil over the years has slowly declined due to the reduced usage of fossil fuels and the spurred utilization of electric energy and vehicles over the years. Even though fossil fuels are currently used for 70% of the world's energy usage, this number is expected to fall and has been over the past few years. With the surplus increasingly expected to persist the rest of the decade and beyond, this era of oil’s geopolitical risk premium faces a downward sloping trajectory. 

The aforementioned increase in supply of oil through the diversification of its production globally, and the reduced demand for its usages, WTI and Brent reflect reduced volatility and prices.
